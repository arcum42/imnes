This is eventually intended to be an nes emulator. Right now, it's mostly a hollow shell of a program, and it's probably never *actually* going to run most games, but it's an interesting project for me, nonetheless, and a good way to get some experience with C++20 modules.

It's using SDL 3 & ImGui. It's based on:
https://github.com/arcum42/sdl3_imgui_example

Or rather, when I got far enough in writing it, I decided it'd be useful to keep that as a template, since I will probably want to write other things with SDL 3 & ImGui in the future.
